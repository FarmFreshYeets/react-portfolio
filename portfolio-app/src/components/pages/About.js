                My name is Camden Grant Van Sciver. I was born at the very end of 2002 in Mesa, Arizona. Having been born in the 21st Century, 
                the internet has always been part of my life. My parents introduced me to computers at a young age and I've always been fascinated by 
                their capabilities and versatility.

                I aspire to be a developer who can create applications that are pleasing to the eye and impressive in solving real world problems. I 
                am a MERN Stack Developer with proficiency in both front-end and back-end development. I also have some basic self-taught experience with 
                Python. I plan to learn as many skills as possible to help me become a better developer.
